QuIP is a web accessible toolset designed to support analysis, management, and exploration of whole slide tissue images for cancer research. The QuIP system consists of a set of docker containers, which provide analysis execution and data management backend services, and web applications to load and visualize whole slide tissue images (in [OpenSlide](http://openslide.org) supported formats), run nuclear segmentation analyses on image tiles, and visualize and explore the analysis results. 

## QuIP Video

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dK4c6ti1Dvc) shows the basic usage of the QuIP system.

## QuIP Demo VM

You may download a demo VMWare VM (in the OVA format) containing all of the docker images and web applications from the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9Sq9MWc46AuOHBZR0tGMTlXOU0/view?usp=sharing). The download size is 16GB. The VM was generated using VMWare Fusion 8.5.3 and may not be compatible with earlier versions of VMWare tools.  

The VM starts all the containers on boot. It is configured to use 2GB memory and 2 CPU cores. Please wait for about 30 seconds for the start process to complete. You can log on to the VM with userid: **quip** and password: **quipdemo**. The Google Chrome browser will open automatically upon login and will bring up the QuIP home page. A TCGA whole slide tissue image is already loaded to the system along with some analysis results. There are additional TCGA whole slide tissue images on /home/quip/Desktop which can be loaded using the Image Loader app accessible from the home page.

# Requirements

1. [docker](https://www.docker.com) should be installed. You should be able to run docker commands (e.g., pull, run).
2. [git](https://git-scm.com) should be installed.
3. QuIP requires access to a folder (data folder) on the host machine to store whole slide tissue images 
   and the database. You should have read and write permissions to the folder.
4. The installation scripts and the QuIP software have been tested on Linux systems and with the Google Chrome 
   browser. 
5. The following three ports should be open to be able to use the web applications: 80, 6002, 3000. 
   
# Cloning the distribution repository

Clone this repository.

    git clone https://github.com/SBU-BMI/quip_distro
         
# Launching the camicroscope viewer VM for wrapping by the isb-cgc webapp in an iframe.

The isb-cgc web app wraps an VM running camicroscope. To configure and launch such a VM execute:
    $ build/buildVM.sh <external IP address>
where <external IP address> is a previously allocated static external IP address.

This script will create a suitably configured VM. It will then copy and execute build/install_deps.sh on the new VM. install_deps 
installs git and docker and then builds the quip-viewer docker image, and finally runs that image.

# Running the containers

Before pulling and running the containers, create a data folder if it does not exist. The data folder will be used to 
store images and the database as well as configuration files required by the containers. Note you should have read and write 
permissions to the folder.

Execute the build_containers_release.sh script. At the command prompt:

    cd <path to your github repositories folder>
    <path to quip_distro folder>/build/build_containers_release.sh
    
Execute the run_containers_release.sh script. At the command prompt:
    
    cd <path to quip_distro folder>
    ./run_containers_release.sh <full path of data folder>


The startup process will create an "img" sub-folder in the data folder where tissue images will be stored and 
a "data" sub-folder where the database files will be stored. Please make sure the storage folder has enough 
space for images and the database. 

The startup process will pull the QuIP containers from their respective docker image repositories, create a user-defined 
docker network (quip_nw), start up the containers and attach them to the user-defined docker network. 

After the containers are started, you may access the QuIP web applications using a browser at `http://<hostname>`. Here, hostname is the name or IP address of the host machine where the containers are running.
